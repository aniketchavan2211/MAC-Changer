# MAC Changer 
 
 A `Media Access Control` address 
 (MAC address) is a unique identifier 
 assigned to a `Network Interface Controller` 
 (NIC) for use as a network address in 
 communications within a network segment.

 Media Access Control
 - Permanent
 - Physical

 **Why to change the MAC Address?**
 - Increase anonymity

 - Bypass filters

## Python

### Variables

 A variable is a location in memory that
 contain a certain value.
 
 Similar to maths, it's a name that is used 
 to store information.

 Examples:
 `X = 1`
 Now X has a value of one, so we can do
 `Y = X+X`
 and y has a value of 2 now.
 ```
 print (Y)
 ```
 will print the value of y on screen which is 2.
 ```
 2
 ```
